Finish enabling(fixing) rest of current PMCs:
	pybuiltin and pyclass the most work I believe
Figure out how will do lexical vars: (some notes in NOTES on this)
	Use parrot LexPad/LexInfo:
		need to decalare lexicals with .lex
	Use modified LexPad:
		make so can store lexical with out prior existence(store_lex)
		but should not beable to find_lex without prior existance(like LexPad)
