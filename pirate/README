# py...rrot 

Pirate is Michal's attempt at a python
compiler for parrot.

It's loosely based on amk's parrot-gen.py:

   http://www.amk.ca/conceit/parrot.html

The main differences so far:

   - pirate uses imcc instead of assemble.pl
   - pirate is backed by unit tests

   - but parrot-gen implements lot more.

I'm actually stealing code bit by bit from
parrot-gen.py and incorporating it into 
pirate. This is my first compiler and my
first attempt at using python parse trees,
so I figured I'd go slow and test first. :)
