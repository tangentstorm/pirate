# **    background
"""

This is basically microthreads:

  - define things to do as generators
  - yield None   to give up control
  - or yield another generator!!

This last one means that your generators
can spawn sub-generators.

@TODO: allow launching threads without waiting

Usage:

w = Worker()
w.assign(yourGenerator)

# and then...

if in_loop:
    w.tick()
else:
    w.work()

You want stuff to happen almost at the same time
but okay to just switch back and forth really fast
if you take too long at one, then the others lock up
so try not to do that!

work left to do. Here's how it looks:

# * implementing generator support
"""
The basic idea here is that generators stay in the queue until they're
done. That means an infinite generator stays int he queue forever, or
at least until someone stops the program.

We still want simple tasks to be removed from the queue immediately
after they are executed, but now we want generators to stick around.
We'll have to modify Worker to make that happen.

Note that we're <strong>defining Worker as a subclass of the earlier
version of Worker.</strong> This is a trick to let us build the class
in stages. It is perfectly legal python syntax, and we will be using
it repeatedly.

"""
Sometimes we want to call clockwork routines from normal python code.

Because of the odd conventions, a clockwork routine only makes sense
inside clockwork, so it can only be called by clockwork-aware
code. But you don't want to cut your features off from all the
non-clockwork code out there, so there has to be a simple way to take
a clockwork routine and wrap it so that it can be used by the outside
world. Well, that's what <code>wrap</code> does.

As of python2.4, there's no easy way to pass a
value back into a running generator. We could
probably cook up some evil trickery to pass
values around on the generator stack, but since
this problem is likely to go away in python2.5,
we'll just use the simple trick of passing in
a result variable. 

Later, once it's implemented, we'll use use
the new expression form of 'yield':
