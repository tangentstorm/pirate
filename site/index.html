<h1>version 0.01 alpha (8/16/2003)</h1>

<p><b><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a></b> is a programming language.<br>
   <b><a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a></b> is a virtual machine
   for running programming langagues.<br>
   <b>Pirate</b> lets parrot run python.</p>

<p>Right now, pirate supports a good deal of python. The two
   biggest things that are still missing are classes 
   (because parrot classes aren't quite done yet)
   and <code>exec/eval/import</code> (because those
   things require a compiler -- and without classes, pirate 
   can't compile itself). None of the builtin functions
   exist, either, and the types are borrowed from perl. :)</p>

<p>BUT: there's still a lot you can do! For example, parrot
   is able to run this generator-based <a href="pirate/weightless.py">microtheads demo</a> 
   and correctly run over 50 small <a href="pirate/PirateTest.py">test cases</a> 
   covering much of the language.</p>
</p>

<p>As a special bonus, it currently runs dog slow! The microthreads
   example runs about 8-9 times slower on pirate than on regular 
   python. But that's not parrot's fault: the generated 
   code is <i>completely</i> unoptimized.</p>

<p>Anyway, want to try it out? You'll need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="pirate-0.01a.tgz">pirate-0.01a.tgz</a> (22kb)</a></li>
  <li>the latest parrot <a href="http://dev.perl.org/cvs/">from cvs</a></li>
  <li>a recent version of python. (I use<a href="http://www.python.org/2.2.3/">2.2.2</a>.
       Python 1.5.2 will <b>not</b> work)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Want to work on the code? </p>
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="pirate/README">README</a> for project goals / cvs access / help wanted / etc</li>
<li>See the <a href="pirate/GUIDE">GUIDE</a> to learn how the code is laid out.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://pirate.versionhost.com/viewcvs.cgi/pirate/">browse the cvs repository</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> looks like this version has an unpassed test case
   dealing with generators. Didn't mean to check that one in, but
   since it's there... Anyone want to give it a shot? The solution
   probably looks something like the PARROT_INLINE() macros in 
   the microthreads demo.

   think!!</p>

<p>PS, a big thanks to <a href="pirate/CREDITS">everyone 
   who helped get it this far</a>!!</p>


<p><b>Future work:</b> Pirate development is currently 
stalled, waiting on a working object system for parrot.</p>
